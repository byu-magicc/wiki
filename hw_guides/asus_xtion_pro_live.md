### Firmware Update
Out of the box this sensor will not function properly if plugged into a USB 3.0 port (or on some computers where the USB 2.0 ports actually run through a USB 3.0 hub). This can be fixed by upgrading the firmware on the sensor using the following steps:

1. Boot into Windows (sorry)
2. Download the firmware update tool from the ASUS website (https://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/MM/Xtion_Pro/FWUpdate_5_8_22.zip)
3. Unzip the archive and run **FWUpdate_RD180x-5.8.22.exe**

Note that after upgrading the firmware, the sensor is only compatible with OpenNI2 and not OpenNI. It will still work if plugged into a USB 2.0 port.
