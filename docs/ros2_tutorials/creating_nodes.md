# Creating Nodes

Now you know most everything you need to know about launch files, it's time to learn how to create your own nodes. However, before we start, it's important for you to know how to set up a C++/Python environment since that is the language we use most often.

## Setting up IDE

When working with large c++ projects, simple text editors like vim or sublime really don't cut it.  Instead, we have IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  

### Setting up CLion

CLion is free for students who apply for a JetBrains student license. You can download it from the Ubuntu app center or from its [official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/#section=linux). 

### Setting up VSCode

VSCode (Visual Studio Code) is completely free. You can download it from the Ubuntu app center or from its [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
