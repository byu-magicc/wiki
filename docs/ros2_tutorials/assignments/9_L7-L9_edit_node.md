# Assignment 9: Editing Teleop Twist Joy Node

Edit `teleop_twist_joy.cpp` so that you no longer need to press the enable button to move the turtle with the joystick.  Test your solution.


## Tips:

 * Very little needs to be changed within the node in order to remove the enable button.  This is more of an exercise on navigating the code.
 * This webpage may be useful in understanding the code more fully: [ROS2 Joy Package](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/p/joy/)
and [ROS Driver for Generic Linux Joysticks](https://github.com/ros-drivers/joystick_drivers/tree/main/joy).
 * Although not necessary for this assignment, this webpage can help you to understand the logging statements: [Logging](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials/Demos/Logging-and-logger-configuration.html#logging)
