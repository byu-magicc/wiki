# Assignment 5: Editing Teleop Twist Joy Node

Edit `teleop_twist_joy.cpp` so that you no longer need to press the enable button to move the turtle with the joystick.  Test your solution.

## Tips:

 * Before starting this assignment it is recommended that you install QT Creator.  QT Creator is a powerful integrated development environment which is useful for editing code.
 * Very little needs to be changed within the node in order to remove the enable button.  This is more of an exercise in being able to navigate the code.
 * This webpage may be useful in understanding the code more fully: [ros::NodeHandle Class Reference](https://docs.ros.org/jade/api/roscpp/html/classros_1_1NodeHandle.html)
 * Although not necessary for this assignment this webpage can help you to understand the logging statements: [Logging](https://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview/Logging)
