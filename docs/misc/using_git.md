# Using Git #

## What is Git ##
We use a git repository to host our code, and manage the different versions. Ultimately, git is a great tool for software development with a lot of functionality to track changes, branch or merge different files, and the ability to quickly clone files from a server to a local computer to work on.

## Installation ##
It's just as easy as all the other programs so far. Simply type

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

## Complete the Tutorial ##
Before you do anything else, you should probably complete the [github tutorial](https://try.github.io/). It takes about 15 minutes, but 15 minutes now is totally worth saving hours over messing up the git repo later.

## Continue ##
Obviously, there's a lot more to learn about git, but there are actually a lot of great resources online that you should look at first. It would be redundant to put all that information here. Git itself has really good [documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) that would teach you everything you could ever want to know about using git, and whatever isn't there, or isn't clear, is probably on some question on [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/)
